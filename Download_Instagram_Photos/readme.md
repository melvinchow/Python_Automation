Download the photos posted by your favorite Instagram photographer!

Runs on Python 3
Works as an executable .py script or run within a jupyter notebook (ipynb) file.

Be advised this script cannot download in bulk. If an instagram post contains more than one image, it will only download the first one.

URL input parameter should be URL of the instagram post, not the profile.
